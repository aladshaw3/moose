# deformations are applied so that the trial stress is
# shear = 10, normalstress = 2
#
# Cohesion is chosen to be 1, and friction angle = 26.565, so tan(friction_angle) = 1/2
# This means that (shear, normalstress) = (0, 2) is the apex
# of the shear envelope
#
# Poisson's ratio is chosen to be zero, and Lame mu = 1E6,
# so the return must solve
# f = 0
# shear = shear_trial - (1/2)*mu*ga = 10 - 0.5E6*ga
# normalstress = normalstress - mu*tan(dilation)*ga
#
# Finally, tan(dilation) = 2/18 is chosen.
#
# Then the returned value should have
# shear = 1, normalstress = 0
#
# Here shear = sqrt(s_yz^2 + s_xz^2)
